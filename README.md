# carrd-vector-coprocessor-dimple
A copy of the codes I wrote for CARRD Vector Coprocessor Thesis Project. 

This repository only contains the Vector Slide Unit, the Writeback module and the top module of the project. The codes are working but still under edting as the whole project is still under the verification and testing phase.

The whole project can be accessed here: https://github.com/rkcalegre/Carrd-Vector-Coprocessor/tree/integrated-coprocessor/Integrated-Coprocessor-v2
